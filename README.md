# Handwritten-Digit-Recognition-using-Artificial-Neural-Network
Handwritten Digit Recognition is a project that uses an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to identify digits (0–9). The model is trained on the MNIST dataset and an interactive canvas allows users to draw digits, which are then predicted by the trained network after preprocessing.
